As for fonts, body text uses *Charter*, a free design by Bitstream, with [small
caps][smcp] extracted from [Charis SIL][silint], another free font based on
Charter, by the SIL group. Titles are set in [League Gothic][league], a free
typeface brought to you by The League of Movable Type. And finally, fixed-width
text uses my own [Fantasque Sans Mono][fantasque].
