I have also used R, Scilab, [Python], Ruby (on Rails), CaML and Prolog. Anyway I am great at reading manuals and Googling
stuff.

I have been using Linux for the past six years, and I tend to use

Inkscape quite well. I also used FontForge a lot.

Typography, reading novels and web comics, drawing stuff (including
[fonts][fantasque]), listening to music.  I also do origami, and I enjoy cooking
and drinking tea.  I was involved for one year in the students' Art Club of my
French engineering school, as treasurer and [web designer][bda].
