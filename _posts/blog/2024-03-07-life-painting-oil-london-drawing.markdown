I'm very excited because I signed up this spring for weekly [oil painting
classes](https://naba.beauxartsparis.fr/offre/peinture-modele-vivant-3h-mardi-14h-18h-2-2-2-2/)
at the Beaux Arts school in Paris, and I'm planning to blog about the classes.

To warm up and to revive my blogging tools, I want to share a few photos from
the only time so far that I've used oil paints: it was during an excellent
one-day life painting workshop in London, in January 2020. Four years ago
already!

End results from all participants.

I have very fond memories of that workshop, because I went with a good friend
and we had a great day, and because the workshop itself was very well
structured, to ease us into "thinking with paint", so to speak. It went like
this:

1. Line drawing with charcoal
2. Tonal drawing with charcoal
3. Tonal underpainting with acrylic
4. Final painting with oil

### The workshop

It was organized by [London Drawing](https://londondrawing.com/), with whom I
did a few events while I lived in London, and they were great each time. See
also [the Klimt and Schiele workshop]({% post_url blog/2019-02-09-klimt-schiele-london-drawing %}).

I recovered a screenshot of the event description, after some chat archeology.

### Warm-up with charcoal lines

We started with charcoal, the model took a short dynamic pose, standing with
legs crossed and an arm raised, we drew her with lines. That was a quick
introduction to warm up our drawing skills, and to move us to the idea that when
painting, what matters is not so much the lines between the inside and the
outside of the model's body, but rather the colour contrast between those two
areas.

### Tonal drawing with charcoal

To switch our minds to drawing with tones instead of lines, we used charcoal at
first. The technique was to spread a medium-grey amount of charcoal over a whole
page of paper, to create a neutral tone, and to carve out of that some lighter
areas with an eraser (to recover the white of the paper), and darker areas with
more charcoal. It was a very interesting way to start thinking about contrast.

### Underpainting with acrylic

We painted on a sheet of relatively thick paper. The tutor helped us prepare on
our palette a series of shades of blue using acrylic paint, by mixing white and
blue paint. As with charcoal, we first painted a medium blue all over the
sheet, then added on top areas of lighter blue or even pure white, and more
saturated blue for darker areas.

The idea was to make a rough painting that would help us by providing guidelines
for composition when applying oil paint on top, and also the tutor said that
having the blue colour in particular behind the oil-based colours would make
them more vibrant. Using acrylic for the underpainting means that it dries very
quickly. I think that it also has technical advantages to have an underpainting
compared to painting with oil directly on paper, but I don't remember the
explanations on that point.

### Final painting

We first prepared a series of skin tone colours on our palette, then followed
the well-laid plan to compose the oil paint layer. Painting with oil was tricky
and quite different from the watercolours that I'm used to, but overall I was
happy with the result. Unfortunately I didn't have time to finish the red rug at
the bottom during the workshop, so I left my painting like that.

I'm now looking forward to learning more techniques specific to oil during my
classes, which start next Tuesday. Stay tuned ðŸ™‚
