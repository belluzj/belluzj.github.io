I went to this life drawing afternoon organized by
[London Drawing](https://londondrawing.com/events/klimt-schiele-the-seductive-line-iii/)
in St Pancras Church, and it was _awesome_!

One of the life drawing models, [reenacting](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtuLVrtHC7Q/)
the painting [_Self Seers II (Death and Man)_](<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Egon_Schiele_-_Self-Seer_II_(Death_and_Man)_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg>)
by Egon Schiele

### The idea

There were 4 different set-ups where life drawing models
re-enacted selected works from
[Gustav Klimt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Klimt)
and [Egon Schiele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egon_Schiele).
The set-ups were impressive, including carefully designed props
and trippy background music, which together created a weird
and inspiring atmosphere, perfect for throwing you out
of your usual way of looking at things. You can check out

### Danaë by Gustav Klimt

The most colorful scene was a superb interpretation of Gustav Klimt's
[Danaë](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana%C3%AB_(Klimt_painting)>),
including rich purple fabrics and the manifestion of Zeus as a
a shiny golden yellow theatre prop.

### More from Egon Schiele

The last set was a mashup between two pieces by Schiele, the drawing
[Black Haired Girl Standing](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Schiele_-_Schwarzhaariger_M%C3%A4dchenakt_stehend_-_1910.jpg)
and the painting
[Small Tree in Late Autumn](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Egon_Schiele_034.jpg).

The London Drawing team who prepared the event managed to find a branch as
tortured as the one depicted by Schiele, and the model was wearing a black
wig in the style of the girl's drawing. I really appreciated that level of
attention to detail, which made the event exceptional.

The model was not only reenacting the drawing. Here, she was wearing a white
shirt and a large ribbon tied around her neck. The lighting coming from below
gave an eerie quality to the scene.
