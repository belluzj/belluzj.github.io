Just after [the drawing class with Savoir/Dessiner]({% post_url /blog/2017-08-06-savoir-dessiner %}),
I attended another course with [Atelier Alupi](http://www.atelieralupi.com/).
It was the same format: one drawing on location in a new place in Paris each day,
for six days.

### Musée de Cluny

The [Cluny museum](http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/lieu/hotel-de-cluny.html)
is about the Middle Ages, but I can't say much more because I have yet to visit
it. What I can tell you is that the entrance courtyard is a nice drawing
subject, thanks to its ornate walls, doors and windows.

The first day of the class was only about drawing. I focused on a door that was
topped by a intricate combination of stone-carved scrolls and clamshells.
Before starting the full-page drawing, we made a smaller version to check the
composition.

I didn't have time to reproduce all the details of the carving, and even less
time to draw correctly the windows in the background. Solution: gray them out,
so that it's clear that they're in the background and so the viewer doesn't try
to look at them too hard.

### View from the Pont des Arts

On the second day, we sat on the [Pont des Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_des_Arts),
from which you get a nice view on the Seine and the City island. The technique
we studied that day is called wash drawing (_lavis_ in French) and is
basically watercolor with only one color. I used Payne's grey, which is a
mixture of black and blue that is usually used for shadows.

We painted directly, without any previous drawing on the page. It forced me to
think before each stroke, but in the end I found that enjoyable and tried to
proceed in the same way during the following days.

Since you only play with contrasts, it's important to make sure that the most
important elements stand out as foreground and background. A technique to get a
better intuition of what should be dark and light is to look at the scene while
squinting.

The dramatic sky is representative of the weather that day. The big clouds were
threatening and it actually rained for a few minutes in the middle of session,
which produced the white dots at the top of the painting (fortunately the rest
of it was under an umbrella).

### Marché Maubert

That day, we settled in a street market called the Marché Maubert. It's quite
small and focused on organic food. I set up my [folding
chair](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/armchair-blue-id_8387464.html) in front of a
fruit and vegetable stand. I tried to paint a few passersby, and at some point
I fell into a never-ending quest to Draw Every Single Vegetable, which of
course I did not have time to complete.

For this one, I painted without a drawing, but it may have helped
to have at least the most important lines to get a better perspective. For
example, the shadow under the vegetable stands was incorrect at first, and I
had to paint and "extension" in the bottom-right corner.

### Jardin du Luxembourg

The [Luxembourg Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardin_du_Luxembourg) is
a beautiful park in Paris, just next to the French Senate. It has trees,
flowerbeds, water basins, statues and lots of chairs everywhere, all of which
make it ideal for drawing and painting.

The goal of the class was to study the difference between light and shadow,
using those two flower pots. One was in the sunlight, the other in the shade of
a tree. In the end, I should have insisted more on the differences in color
between the two.

### Pont Alexandre III

Once again painting from the banks of the Seine, we studied the [Alexander III
bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_Alexandre_III). We tried to use only
two colors, one for the light and another for the shadows. This time I drew
again before painting, both a small composition sketch and a full-page drawing.

### Notre Dame

Finally on the last day, we painted the iconic
[Notre Dame de Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris)
cathedral, as seen from the Saint Louis island (i.e. from behind).

I'm quite satisfied with that one because I think it's the first of my
paintings that is a bit "understated" and looks more like watercolors than
gouache.

As a conclusion, I enjoyed a bit more the previous drawing course, for two
reasons. The first is that this course lasted only two hours and a half just
before lunch, and it was often not enough for me to finish the painting (and
afterwards I was hungry so I just went home to eat). The second one might be
that after learning basic but very important techniques in the first course, I
should have spent some time practicing that before starting another course
straight away. At times I felt that I was still practicing the techniques from
the previous class instead of benefiting from new advice from this new teacher.
That being said, the selection of locations for the course was fantastic, and
the whole experience was once again very enjoyable.
