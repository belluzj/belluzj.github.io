I took up watercolors a few months ago. I started with very nice videos
by [Jacques Williet][williet]. I would warmly recommend his tutorials to French
speakers because the videos are really focused on the artwork being created,
and because the artist explains color choices as he goes. As a bonus, the calm
tone of voice and soothing jazz music turn each video into a spa-worthy
relaxing experience.

### First steps

The first time that I got my watercolors, I embarked on painting a photo from
my holidays in Étretat. As you can see, it doesn't look much like watercolor.

At first I was putting too much paint and the result looked like gouache.

After that I started to reproduce some of the tutorials by Jacques Williet,
namely [the sunflowers][sunflowers], [the roses][roses] and
[the sunset][sunset]. I did not try to do the best I could every time,
in the sense that I painted quite fast and did not care much about the details.
You can see that mostly on the sunflowers: the petal are messy, and the dark
green that went in-between doesn't quite fill the holes between the flowers.
But anyway, I enjoy watercolor for that reason: I can work roughly an hour and
have a result at the end.

Most things are off with this bouquet: the blue in the background and the pot's
color are dirty, the shadow looks out of place and the flowers could be
said to be blurry by a benevolent critique. Also, the shadows in-between the
flowers take up too much space. [Check out the original video][sunflowers].

[Compared to Jacques Williet's video][roses], my roses' petals are not as crisp,
probably because I did not focus on "coloring the shadows that petals cast on
each other". Also, just like the sunflowers, the darker area in the middle is
too large and features an unwelcome bubble-like pattern left by an excess of
water after it dried.

I'm rather happy with that last one, apart from the fact that the dark landscape at
the bottom is too high and mostly hides a clever technique
[from the tutorial video][sunset]: we paint a first lighter background at the
bottom, let it dry, and then add over it the Payne's gray foreground.

In the end, my sunset watercolor is quite different from Jacques Williet's,
more than anything it has far fewer details, in the clouds and in the landscape.
That's part of my plan to keep watercolors enjoyable by doing short sessions.

I also tried doing something on my own, from
[a photo of the Sanzenin garden in Japan](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanzenin1.jpg).
Again I think that I put a bit too much paint.

### Materials and tools

This plastic box is convenient because it's small enough to be taken on a trip
and used outside (there's a handle on its underside).

I started with 12 half-pan set from from Lefranc & Bourgeois, featured in the
above picture.  After the first few YouTube
tutorials, I went back to the art supplies shop, Rougier & Plé, looking for
a [half-pan][caputmortuum1] [of][caputmortuum2] [Caput][caputmortuum3]
[Mortuum][caputmortuum4], which I bought along with a new brush and a new paper
block.

Now I look at clouds differently.

To have more colors, I ordered from Amazon a huge Winsor & Newton "Cotman"
Studio Set watercolors palette, with 45 half-pans, because it was cheap: only
38€ at the time.
I completed my 24-slot palette with 11 colors from the Cotman set, plus 1
half-pan of Caput Mortuum from Sennelier. I'm very happy with the final setup:
I have enough colors and I can carry them around easily. I recommend the Cotman
set because it's comprehensive and cheap. Although I heard/read that the quality
is not the best (the grade of the Cotman colors is only "fine", instead of
"extra fine" for the traditional Winsor & Newton colors), I didn't feel that it
was a problem for a novice like me.

As for paper, I was advised to start with the cheapest paper in the store,
which weighed 250 g/m² and had the regular "dotted" grain that you can see in
this post's paintings. *I don't recommend it.* I recently bought a Canson paper
block at 300 g/m² with a softer grain, which was only slightly more expensive,
(mid-range product) and it already feels a lot better to work on.

Finally, for brushes: I was also advised to start with the least expensive
brushes, as long as they were made from natural hair. "Petit gris" is the
cheapest natural kind of brushes. I bought 3 simple round brushes of various
sizes (the gray ones in the picture). On my second visit to the art shop,
another salesperson recommended the Raphael quill mop brushes (*pinceaux à
lavis* in French) and it was the **best piece of advice ever**. I bought only
a small one (with the wooden handle, second from the left in the picture), but
I'm definitely going to get a second, larger one soon. This brush is magical
in two ways:

1. The piece of plastic held with metal strings acts as a reservoir, which
allows the brush to hold more water. You can easily achieve gradients for
example, if you only put paint on the tip of the brush and slide it laterally.
Also you don't have to dampen it again so often.

2. The pointy arrangement of the hairs allows to get varying stroke widths very
easily, and give a more "dynamic" feeling to leaves or petals for examples, such
as the [sunflower petals in the video][sunflowers].

I also got a very cheap synthetic flat brush for details. That's what I brought
with me to New York City last month, to make my first
[*carnet de voyage*][carnet]!
