In July, I took a drawing class in Paris with
[Savoir/Dessiner](http://www.savoirdessinerparis.fr/):
three days, three locations. I wanted to learn the basic techniques of drawing.
While I enjoyed drawing in my free time, I knew there were basic principles
that I never had the chance to learn and practice.


### Jardin Eugène-Napoléon

On the first day, I was taught how to measure angles and proportions using a
pencil. I had seen people holding their pencils in front of them in movies, but
I used to read the gesture as "look at me, I'm artisting!". The point of
the first session was to get the correct perspective of the building of the
[Fondation Engène-Napoléon](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fondation_Eug%C3%A8ne-Napol%C3%A9on).

[Savoir/Dessiner's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BW2uVJsDcqz/).
The nice thing about the class is that while each of us practiced the
technique they enjoyed best, the teacher had useful and relevant advice
for everyone.

### Musée Bourdelle

The second day took place at the
[Antoine Bourdelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Bourdelle)
[museum of Paris](http://www.bourdelle.paris.fr/en).
The goal was to produce as many drawings as possible during the four hours
of the session, in order to let the hand run free and have more spontaneous
drawings. I started drawing with a felt-tip marker, because that's a style
I enjoy a lot in comic books.

This last statue is called
[Hercules the Archer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_the_Archer).

### Banks of the Seine

On the last day, we settled on the banks of the Seine river, on the tip
of the Saint-Louis island, with a view on the City island and the Right
Bank. I combined a felt-tip drawing with watercolors.

Overall, the [Savoir/Dessiner](http://www.savoirdessinerparis.fr/)
class was an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, and I would recommend
it to anyone wishing to draw interesting landscapes of Paris.
