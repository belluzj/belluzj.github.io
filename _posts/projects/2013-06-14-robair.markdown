[RobAIR][wiki_home] is a joint project between several schools and laboratories
in Grenoble, aimed at designing a telepresence robot. The idea is for example
to visit a museum without actually going there, but to send RobAIR instead. Its
camera and microphones will be your eyes and ears, while his speakers and
screen will assure your vocal and visual presence. A tablet can be used to see
what RobAIR sees, and give him piloting instructions. The whole project is
totally open source, and based on free technologies such as Ubuntu and [ROS
(the Robot Operating System)][ROS] tries to use cheap and widely available
components, such as [Arduino cards][arduino] or Kinect sensors.


I worked with three other students on software parts for the piloting part of
RobAIR. Our tasks included documentation work about algorithms for crowd
avoidance and writing ROS nodes to implement those algorithms. Unfortunately
the robot was not ready for testing when we reached the ROS implementation
part, so instead we did some soldering and breadboard design, and wrote Arduino
code for RobAIR's obstacle-avoidance sensors.

More information about our work
can be found on [our team's wiki page][wiki_our], and some of the code is
available in [this GitHub repository][github].

In the end I also realized a [presentation flyer (in French)][flyer] showing
off the next iteration of the RobAIR series, made by another team of students
(with purple flower pots instead of wood for the body. Did I mention
affordable?)
