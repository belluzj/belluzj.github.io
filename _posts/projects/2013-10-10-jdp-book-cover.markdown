Every year, our school host a whole-day event called *Journ√©e des Partenaires*.
More than 50 companies, big players as well as start-ups, gather in the
school's buildings to present their job openings, to meet students and
interview them. In order to get prepared for this unique opportunity, all
students are given a booklet which sums up the activity and the offerings of
every involved company. I had the pleasure to design [the cover of this
book.](/public/jdp_book_cover.pdf)

I used Inkscape to draw and position elements. The main fonts are three weights
of Lato, a free and high quality typeface. You can also spot Din and Airstrip
Four, which are part of the school's visual identity, as well as the dominant
shade of green.

[The whole
booklet](http://cv-michel-kuhm.net23.net/documents/book_final_web.pdf) can be
found on the website of [Michel Kuhm](http://michelkuhm.com/), who typeset it
and reviewed the contents. More information about the event itself can be found
at the student association which organizes it, the [BDE
Entreprises](http://bde-entreprise.ensimag.fr/).
