Fantasque Sans Mono <small><del>Cosmic Sans Neue Mono</del>[^name]</small>
-------------------

[^name]:
    Previously known as *Cosmic Sans Neue Mono*. It appeared that [similar
    names were already in use for other
    fonts](https://github.com/belluzj/cosmic-sans-neue/issues/16), and that
    people tended to extend their instinctive hatred of Comic Sans to this very
    font of mine (which of course can only be *loved*). Why the previous name?
    Here is my original explanation:

**A programming font,**
designed with functionality in mind,
and with some wibbly-wobbly
handwriting-like fuzziness
that makes it unassumingly cool.

I use it for monospaced text on this website (expect some blog posts about my
*dotfiles* with many code samples to look at).  Development takes place [on
GitHub][fantasque-github], were you can also find some more screenshots.

The way I ended up with this font is a bit convoluted. I first drew a
proportional font in Inkscape, which I then imported into FontForge. Since it
looked too thin, I tried to "embolden" it automatically using FontForge's
tools. The results were not satisfying: some letters had strange darts pointing out and
misplaced curves. I tried to improve that by modifying a bit every letter by
hand, but it did not get me anywhere. 

This is the proportional version (Fantasque Sans), which I designed in Inkscape.

At some point I thought it might make a good monospaced font. I started
stretching the letters (and added that tail on the `i` that some people hate).
I had the regular version, with Latin characters only.

Then I emboldened it using FontForge, but moving the path handles by hand. I
published my font [on GitHub][fantasque-github], and asked for reviews on
[Reddit's /r/typography][reddit]. Finally, I followed the advice from
redditors, and I also added Greek letters.
